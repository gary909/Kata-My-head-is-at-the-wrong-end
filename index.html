    <h1>Kata: My head is at the wrong end!</h1>
    <h2>Open the console...</h2>
    <p>
      You're at the zoo... all the meerkats look weird. Something has gone
      terribly wrong - <br />
      someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!<br />
      <br />
      Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which
      will have <br />
      three values (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so
      that the <br />
      animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).<br />
      <br />
      Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests:
      you have to <br />
      change the element positions with the same exact logics<br />
      <br />
      Simples!<br />
